(!) In **MS Word**, kerning is applied to the text _as an option_, it is not a parameter that you activate for all your documents. You find it in the advanced parameters of Fonts settings: you have to check the box and specify a minimum text size to apply kerning (5pt for Mac and 8pt for Windows).
(!)(!) **MS Word** creates a fake bold and a fake italic when style linking is absent or not working properly.
(!)(!)(!) Don't forget to remove fonts from fonts folder at the end of testing.

## COMPATIBILITY
If your fonts of different formats have the same naming, you will have to test formats one by one, restarting the computer between each to avoid cache issues and conflicts. If they have a different naming system, eg. "NameCFF.otf", "NameTT.ttf", "NameVF.ttf", we suggest to also test their compatibility when installed on the same machine.

- [ ] No conflict during installation
- [ ] All fonts are displayed in the fonts folder with their respective naming
- [ ] They can be displayed on the same sheet in whatever software with no trouble

## TT HINTING (from 9-10ppm to 50ppm)
- You can use image-waterfall generated by diffbrowser (if you have gftools-qa installed)
- If you use a html page: display in in firefox or chrome on a normal resolution screen (higher than HD is probably not very useful)

- Since hinting is managed by fontmake, there is not much to do except looking if the font is better with or without hinting. For that you can use [GF Regression](http://35.238.63.0) and upload 2 versions of generated font (hinted and unhinted).

You can still check what hinting is made for:
- [ ] All glyphs are well aligned: if you see your /r higher than other letter, it is probably because top point is out of the blue zone. So checks where your guidelines normally are (baseline, x-height, caps-height, ascenders, descenders)
- [ ] Superior and inferiors figures are well aligned too with each other.
- [ ] No overshoot until 48-50ppm
- [ ] Glyphs are aligned also between styles (bold is not higher than Regular at the same ppm size)
- [ ] All glyphs of the same set look consistent (there is no glyph better or worse than the other)
- [ ] Letters are readable
- [ ] Weight is equally distributed (horizontally and vertically) in symmetrical letters (o, e g, c)
- [ ] Spacing is not messed up
- [ ] Accents don't clash with letters
- [ ] Counter-shaped are not closed (e, g, ring)
- [ ] Upright and italic of the same weight have a consistent weight
- [ ] Dots on /i and /j are aligned
