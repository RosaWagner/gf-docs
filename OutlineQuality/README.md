# Outline Quality Checklist

Make sure your font is ready for mastering by fulfilling this checklist. Design is not particularly judge here, we are talking from the point of view of the technical quality aspect of a font, i.e: what you see in your font editor is what will everyone see on their own screen or printed matter.

## Contours
### Segments

- [ ] **Mixed outline type :** the outlines of one font must be either PostScript (OpenType Fonts font with CFF compression / .otf) or TrueType (OpenType Fonts with TrueType compression / .ttf). Fontlab 5 allows mixed curve type within the same glyph.
- [ ] **Wrong direction :** For PS outlines, the outer-shape goes counter clock-wise, and the inner-shape (or counter-shape) goes clockwise. It is the reverse for TT outlines: outer-shape goes clockwise et counter-shape goes counter clockwise. We usually use PS curves for design, and they are then converted to TT when exporting TTF fonts. Whatever the chose outlines, make sure it is consistent accross the entire family.
- [ ] **Almost straight :** if a segment is misaligned of one or two units, it may be a mistake from the designer. This small offset can cause a big misinterpretation form the rasterizer at small ppm sizes.
- [ ] **Missing inflexion point :** It is considered that a curve has a *suspicious inflexion* when it is a single segment going from convex to concave (and vise versa). We need to divide this segment by adding a node at the point where the curve is changing condition, therefore the tangeant represented by the the two handles crosses the curve.
- [ ] **Collinear :** If two line-segments are connected with the same angle (or almost the same angle), or with a slight offset, it means that the entire line could be made with one segment (two points not more).
- [ ] **Short :** Segments of 1 or 2 units are often used to make inktraps, but they are also sometimes unwanted and, again, can be wildly rendered on some screens.
- [ ] **Open :** A contour can only be considered as such if it has a closed path, otherwise it won't be rendered at all.
- [ ] **Overlaying :** It disturbs rendering, interpolation and variation.
- [ ] **Overlapping :** The crossing of two independants contours is not such a problem in VF (although small overlaps are preferred), and generally merged during generation to static binaries. If you want to control the result of the merging, it is better do it yourself. If not, try to keep small overlapped area. Also try to not overlap more than 2 contours in the same area (contour crossing a contour itself crossing another contour, like asterisk, creates confusion during generation and rendering). In any case, try to avoid overlapping shapes which crosses a plain shape and a closed counter-shape (typically, Oslash should be manually merged for example).
- [ ] **Self-crossing :** Often known as open-corners, it is very helpful while designing and recommended for nice interpolations. They will be preserved for VF fonts and merged during generation to static binaries. If you want to control the result of the merging, do it yourself, if not, same advises as above.

### On-curve points (nodes)

- [ ] **Overlaying :** Also called "empty segments" because they don't have a length. They are often useless and sometimes confusing for hinting and rendering â€” except for some rare cases of variations.
- [ ] **Missing on extremes :**
- [ ] **Fractional coordinates :**

### Off-curve points (handles)
- [ ] **Almost straight :**
- [ ] **Broken smooth connection :**
- [ ] **Inside node :**
